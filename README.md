## Overview

In this repository, you will find a detailed analysis of a Kaggle dataset focused on wine quality. The work involves experiments with three machine learning algorithms, including hyperparameter tuning, and an exploration of various data processing techniques. This project aims to demonstrate the application of AI in evaluating and classifying wine quality through various methodologies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zach10w/IA-Classification-Analysis.git
cd IA-Classification-Analysis
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and focuses on wine quality attributes. It includes various features such as acidity, sugar content, and other chemical properties, along with a target variable representing the wine quality score.

- **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
- **Key Features:**
  - Fixed Acidity
  - Volatile Acidity
  - Citric Acid
  - Residual Sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Free Sulfur Dioxide
  - Total Sulfur Dioxide
  - Density
  - pH
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol
  - Quality

## Machine Learning Algorithms

In this project, I explore three machine learning algorithms:

1. **Logistic Regression:** This algorithm is simple and effective for binary classification problems.
2. **Random Forest Classifier:** A versatile ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Effective for high-dimensional spaces and offers flexibility through the kernel trick.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Each algorithm underwent hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance. Grid search was employed to systematically work through multiple combinations of parameter tunes.

## Techniques and Analysis

### Outlier Detection

Outliers can skew the results of the analysis. Techniques such as Z-score and IQR (Interquartile Range) were used to identify and manage outliers within the dataset.

### Correlation Analysis

Understanding the relationships between different features is vital. A correlation matrix was generated to visualize and quantify these relationships.

### Normalization

To ensure fair treatment of all features during analysis, normalization techniques were applied. Min-Max scaling was used to transform the features into a uniform range.

## Results

The results from each algorithm provide valuable insights into the classification of wine quality. The evaluation metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

### Confusion Matrix

Confusion matrices were generated to illustrate the performance of each model. This visual representation helps in understanding the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative classifications.

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will trigger the data loading, processing, model training, and evaluation steps.
